Connect all/One Click/

USE CASES
1.	A regular job seeker applies for n number of jobs daily. It would be very tough to navigate to each job link. So, with this extension user can aggregate all the job urls into a single mode and on one click can open all the tabs and check the status. These modes can also be shared globally with other users and users can also rate each mode.
2.	User can create modes of their desired interest like work, entertainment, music, news.
3.	User can visualize the time that he spends on each category and each domain.
4.	For a user who has a lot of bookmarks, it would be difficult for him to search for a specific bookmark. So, we categorize the bookmarks which gives an opportunity for a user to search for a bookmark easily. Same is the case with history.
MVP Requirements
1.	Python script to crawl through the website and get categorized url.
2.	UI which gives user an interface to create/view mode.
3.	Should categorize bookmarks and history.
4.	Visualizing the dynamic data generated from user browsing.
5.	Modes can be share globally with other users.
6.	User can search/rate a mode and can select a mode that has higher ratings.
Additional Features
1.	Saves memory and reduces tab clutter in Chrome.
2.	Gives us an environment to work in modes rather than tabs.
3.	Reduces users number of clicks.
